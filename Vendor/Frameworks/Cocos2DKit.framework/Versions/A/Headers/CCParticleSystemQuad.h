/** CCParticleSystemQuad is a subclass of CCParticleSystem
 
 It includes all the features of ParticleSystem.
 
 Special features and Limitations:	
 - Particle size can be any float number.
 - The system can be scaled
 - The particles can be rotated
 - On 1st and 2nd gen iPhones: It is only a bit slower that CCParticleSystemPoint
 - On 3rd gen iPhone and iPads: It is MUCH faster than CCParticleSystemPoint
 - It consumes more RAM and more GPU memory than CCParticleSystemPoint
 - It supports subrects
 - It supports batched rendering since 1.1
 @since v0.8
